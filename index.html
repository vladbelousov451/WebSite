                            Good web design is often about good typography. Since so much of a web page's content is presented as text, being able to style that text to be both attractive and effective is an important skill to possess as a web designer. Unfortunately, we do not have the same level of typographic control online that we do in print. This means that we cannot always reliably style text on a website in the same way that we could do so in a printed piece.


                            One common paragraph style that you do see often in print (and which we can recreate online) is where the first line of that paragraph is indented one tab space. This allows readers to see where one paragraph begins and another ends.


                            You don't see this visual style as much in web pages because browsers, by default, display paragraphs with space underneath them as a way to show where one ends and another begins, but if you want to style a page to have that print-inspired indent style on paragraphs, you can do so with the text-indent style property.

                            The syntax for this property is simple. Here is how you would add a text-indent to all the paragraphs in a document.

                            Background Burner is a free and intuitive web app to remove the background from any image. As usual, you start by uploading your photo to the app. It’ll then try to remove the background from your image automatically. Once finished, it outputs 3–4 copies of the processed images. Out of these, you choose the best picture.

                            Procedure
                            If the photo you uploaded isn’t complex, you’ll most likely find the perfect image. Click the Select button to download the image. The app also gives the option to touch up a nearly perfect image. Click the Touchup button to open the new editing window. Behind the scene, the app uses the ClippingMagic mechanism.

                            You can choose from three brush sizes, undo the steps, and zoom images to mark them with precision. Then, click the Pixel Tools button to manually erase the background (or restore the foreground), or use the polygon shaped tools to fine-tune the edges.

                            Pros and Cons
                            Background Burner does pretty much all the heavy lifting itself. Since the app is free to use, you can save both time and money. If you’re planning to remove the background from several pictures, then this app should be your first choice.

                            When it comes to images that are a bit more complex, the automatic results are not as good in comparison to other apps. Background Burner lacks complex editing tools to fine-tune the images, bulk clipping mode, and custom settings.
